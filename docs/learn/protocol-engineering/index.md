# Protocol Engineering Track

The Protocol Engineering track is an advanced engineering curriculum for developers building decentralized applications, complex smart contracts, and Web3 infrastructure.
It emphasizes production-grade practices, the Foundry development framework, rigorous testing methodologies, and smart contract auditing.

## Target Outcomes

Upon completing this track, developers will be able to:

- Establish a reproducible local EVM development environment using Foundry (Forge, Cast, Anvil).
- Write secure, gas-efficient Solidity contracts with a clear mental model of EVM storage layout.
- Implement and extend standard contract architectures including ERC-20, ERC-721, and UUPS upgradeable proxies.
- Write robust unit tests, invariant fuzz tests, and gas benchmarks using Forge.
- Build production DeFi primitives including constant product AMMs, staking pools, and oracle integrations.
- Connect full-stack frontend web applications to smart contracts using Viem, Wagmi, and modern connection libraries.
- Run static analysis tools, identify common smart contract vulnerabilities, and draft structured audit reports.

## Prerequisites

- Proficiency in general programming concepts (functions, loops, data structures, and asynchronous execution).
- Familiarity with the Linux command line and Git version control.
- Completion of the [Builder Foundations](/learn/builder-foundations/) track or equivalent practical Solidity experience.

## Curated Syllabus

### Phase 1: Local Development Environment & Modern Tooling

   - Defining and implementing standardized interfaces.
4. **Low-Level Calls & Address Interactions**
   - Sending Ether with `call`, `transfer`, and `send`.

2. **ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens**
   - Token ownership mappings, minting workflows, and safe transfer checks.
   - Metadata architecture: off-chain IPFS storage versus fully on-chain SVG rendering.
3. **ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard**
   - Batch transfers, mixed fungible and non-fungible balances, and gas savings.
4. **Upgradeable Proxy Patterns**
   - The delegatecall proxy mechanism and storage collision risks.
   - EIP-1967 storage slots.
   - Transparent Upgradeable Proxies versus Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS).

### Phase 4: Rigorous Testing, Fuzzing & Gas Optimization

1. **Solidity-Native Testing with Forge**
   - Structuring tests, assertions, and console logging in Solidity.
   - Forge cheatcodes including `prank`, `deal`, `warp`, `roll`, `expectRevert`, and `expectEmit`.
2. **Fuzzing & Invariant Testing**
   - Stateless fuzz testing: generating random inputs to detect edge-case overflows and assumptions.
   - Stateful invariant testing: defining system invariants across sequential multi-step actor transactions.
3. **Gas Profiling & Optimization Techniques**
   - Generating gas reports and snapshots with `forge snapshot`.
   - Optimization patterns: caching array lengths, unchecked math, custom errors, and slot packing.

### Phase 5: DeFi Protocol Engineering & Oracles

1. **Constant Product Automated Market Makers**
   - Architecting a Uniswap v2 core exchange: pair contracts, factory pattern, and liquidity tokens.
   - Computing swap output amounts with 0.3 percent fees without floating-point math.
2. **Staking & Reward Distribution Algorithms**
   - Implementing scalable reward distribution using the Synthetix staking rewards algorithm.
   - Time-weighted average rewards per token to eliminate iterative looping over stakers.
3. **Collateralized Borrowing & Liquidation Engines**
   - Tracking user collateral balances, debt positions, and health factors.
   - Designing permissionless liquidation callbacks with bonus collateral incentives.
4. **Chainlink Oracles & Verifiable Randomness**
