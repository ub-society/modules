# Blockchain Fundamentals Track

The Blockchain Fundamentals track provides a rigorous conceptual and architectural foundation in distributed ledgers, cryptographic primitives, and decentralized protocols.
It synthesizes core computer science principles with real-world blockchain mechanics, omitting speculative trading material in favor of protocol engineering concepts.

## Target Outcomes

Upon completing this track, learners will be able to:

- Trace the historical evolution and computer science breakthroughs that led to decentralized consensus.
- Understand how cryptographic hash functions, asymmetric keypairs, and Merkle trees guarantee data integrity.
- Compare how state transitions occur across UTXO and account-based blockchain architectures.
- Evaluate the security, finality guarantees, and trade-offs between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and BFT consensus.
- Analyze virtual machine execution environments, gas metering mechanics, and the role of oracles.
- Deconstruct the mathematical mechanics of automated market makers, collateralized lending, and token distribution models.
- Explain Layer 2 scaling architectures including Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge rollups.

## Prerequisites

- High-level familiarity with computer science concepts (data structures, networking basics, and state machines).
- General comfort reading algorithmic pseudocode and architectural diagrams.
- No prior smart contract programming experience required.
